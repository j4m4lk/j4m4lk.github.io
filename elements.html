							<p> This was my dissertation for masters in Computer Science in Games programming which objective was to explore integrating Finite State Machines (FSM) and Behaviour Trees (BTs) in game AI systems to understand AI decision-making subtleties. Traditional AI systems in video games have drawbacks, while BTs, known for their modularity and complexity representation, offer a viable alternative. The research covers the evolution of game AI from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated, learning-facilitated configurations. It includes developing an AI system for a First-Person Shooter (FPS) game, comparing FSMs and BTs, assessing AI complexity and adaptability, and evaluating player immersion. The study demonstrates that FSMs are best for linear tasks with little customization, while BTs provide a flexible, extendable AI solution. Combining FSMs with BTs and incorporating reinforcement learning into BTs is also explored. Using Unity, the dissertation visually represents AI systems by contrasting FSM and BT-based scenes, highlighting AI modularity and fluidity. The research aims to bridge the gap between simple adaptive AI and traditional game AI, offering a comprehensive framework to enhance AI adaptability in video games and real-world applications. </p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>This was my First DirectX project, I deepened my understanding of C++ programming. My previous experience with OpenGL proved beneficial, with most challenges arising from syntax differences and the reversed Z axis. I significantly benefited from the graphics debugger in Visual Studio, which simplified the shader code debugging process. To achieve an expansive terrain, I embraced instance rendering, drawing numerous cubes in a single call, enhancing performance. I also developed various particle effects using screen-aligned quads and employed both parallax and cube mapping for richer visual effects on terrain and rocket simulations and animations, respectively. Reflecting on the project, recognizing areas for potential improvement like the particle effects and considering external configurations for simulation constants.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Built using Directx Libraries and using websock2, I delved deep into threading and networking within C++, leading to the creation of a real-time 3D networked application. The foundation of this endeavor was the Rocket simulation I had previously developed, which provided an opportunity to rectify its flaws while building a comprehensive Simulation. I employed a thread pool for threading, encapsulating C++ threads within classes and managing potential thread contention using lock guards. Networking was achieved via a peer-to-peer structure using clientâ€“server system. The concept involved players drawing on a 3D canvas, with cubes signifying their mass; a player could "steal" from another's canvas, affecting both canvases' colors. In reflection, while the application showcased minimal latency and reliable data transmission even under simulated poor network conditions.</p>

							<img src="images/underwater.png" alt="" style="width:700px; height:500px;" />
						</span>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Developed with the DirectX libraries, in the geometry shader, I generate the terrain using a noise function to adjust its height and create an underwater texture. By examining the gradient of each point with its neighboring noise values, I generate normals, which let me apply basic Phong shading. I also pass a set of control points into the shader to produce plants at each position. I manipulate their vertices over time to simulate the swaying effect of a breeze and employ alpha blending for transparent backgrounds. Additionally, I craft implicit shapes using ray marching tied to distance functions and encase these shapes in a bounding box, optimizing the ray marching process and reducing the necessary steps to reach each shape.</p>

							<p>I developed a tower defense simulation using OpenGL to demonstrate my expertise in AI. I designed a collision system to identify interactions between agents, towers, and their projectiles. I utilized both the Runge-Kutta and Euler methods for ball-ground collisions, giving the balls random movement patterns. Additionally, I incorporated spatial segmentation for the terrain.</p>

							<p>I developed a surgical simulation in the Unity engine, leveraging HoloLens libraries to provide a comprehensive AR experience. The project incorporated core mixed reality features such as the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK), Positioning, Interaction, Eye tracking, and Voice commands. I utilized these AR capabilities to simulate airway insertion, enabling users to manipulate a controller to insert a cable into an airway, and providing a visual from a camera positioned at the cable's tip to view the interior of the airway. Furthermore, the simulation integrated Azure functionalities, specifically Spatial Anchors and Holographic Remoting.</p>

						<p>This was a concept game called Santa Slider that i made with a group of my collegues based on 3 random word we were assigned in the ThreeThing GameJam, we made this in unity using basic programming and basic free assests from the unity store. We got 3rd place overall and it was my first GameJam participation.</p>
